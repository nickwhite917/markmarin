# Overview
This project was created for a friend of mine. Its code should **not** be used for any other purpose since it is buggy, and just plan **bad**. It was created to fill a very specific set of requirements, for a very specific academic homework assignment. It utilizes PHP, MySQL, and the regular web languages.
